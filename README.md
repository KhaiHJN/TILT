## Intention

The purpose of this project is to provide a solution for monitoring the status of a destination COVID-19 restrictions and situation, or whatever the user want to monitor the current situation. Travel Informer, Little Traveler (TILT) is a website that uses [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) to run with [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) for hosting. We are using it to deliver data such as:
+ [Entry rules (Regjeringen.no)](https://www.regjeringen.no/no/tema/Koronasituasjonen/id2692388/)
+ [COVID-19 statistics (Worldometers.info)](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/)

This is to help the traveler determine what the situation is like at a destination before traveling.

## Installing and running
This webpage is meant to be run on docker.

Step-by step:

1. ```git clone https://github.com/KhaiHJN/TILT ```

2. ```cd TILT``` and run ```docker build -t tilt:latest .``` This will install Flask, Request and package the python files, making imports more trivial.

3. Then run ``` docker run -d -p 5000:5000 tilt``` This starts the webserver.

4. Go to ``` 0.0.0.0:5000 ``` on your browser to see the the webpage.

These steps will create a Flask webserver and run it on docker, but will only make it accessible from within the local network. Opening Port Forwarding at port :5000 means it can be accessed from outside network. Check with your internet provider how to do this. 

**DISCLAIMER:** Port forwarding is done at your own risk. We take no responsibility.
